## 1. Material Inventory

**Content Sources:**
- User-provided content: Comprehensive section descriptions in requirements
- Social links: 4 external links (Producer.ai, LinkedIn, GitHub, Gist)
- Interactive elements: Chaos meter, uptime counter, terminal UI, animated backgrounds
- Projects: Song titles and creative works metadata

**Visual Assets:**
- To be sourced: Profile photo, homelab images, project thumbnails
- Decorative: Network diagrams, server illustrations, LED animations (handled in design spec)

**Data Elements:**
- Bio timeline: 1995 ISP story, career milestones
- Projects list: Songs and creative works
- Philosophy concepts: Systems thinking frameworks

## 2. Website Structure

**Type:** SPA (Single Page Application)

**Reasoning:** 
- Content volume: ~2000-2500 words across 7 sections
- Single cohesive narrative: All content showcases iLude's multifaceted identity
- User goal: Quick exploration of personality layers with smooth flow
- Interactive elements benefit from single-page smooth scroll experience
- 7 sections create natural scrolling story rather than fragmented pages

## 5. Content Analysis

**Information Density:** Medium
- Estimated word count: 2000-2500 words
- 7 main sections with varied content types
- Balance of serious philosophy and playful mythology

**Content Balance:**
- Text: ~60% (philosophy, stories, concepts)
- Interactive elements: ~25% (widgets, animations, effects)
- Visual assets: ~15% (profile, homelab photos, icons)

**Content Type:** Mixed
- Narrative storytelling (About, Lore)
- Conceptual frameworks (Philosophy, Architecture)
- Creative portfolio (Projects, Songs)
- Interactive playground (Widgets, terminal UI)

**Design Implications:**
- Needs strong visual hierarchy to separate serious vs playful sections
- Dark mode essential for terminal/tech aesthetic
- Generous spacing to prevent content overload
- Interactive elements must enhance, not distract from content
